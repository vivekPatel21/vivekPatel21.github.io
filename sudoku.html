        <p>This is a sudoku program I programmed in Java that is capable of solving any sudoku problem of any given
            dimension.
            It can solve the classic 9x9 sudoku board or even the 50x50 sudoku board if you so choose. It comes complete
            with JUnit
            testing implemented and a few demo problems and examples to help you get started. You can find the github
            repository
            <a href="https://github.com/vivekPatel21/SodukuSolver">here</a> or you can download it yourself <a
                href="images\SodukuSolver-main.zip">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Guide</h2>
        <p>The program reads text files as input with the first number being the dimensions of the sudoku board and the
            periods
            representing unknown tiles. You can create this text file by copying what you see on the board then feeding
            it to the program.
            It will then tell you the first solution it finds, or tell you that the puzzle is unsolvable.
        </p>

        <p>Here is an example of how your input file should look</p>

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>The time and space complexity of this program is O(n^n) where n is the dimensions of the puzzle which does
            sound worrying,
            but by taking advantage of backtracking and recursive techniques, this time is greatly reduced but is not
            reflected in
            big O notation.
            The puzzle is solved by creating a 2D array to store the current working solution the program is developing.
            The program works by creating a tree structure with every possible solution. The program however only
            works on one branch at a time
            which greatly improves performance. The program navigates the tree using post order tree traversal.

        <p>The program goes through the sudoku problem trying a new number in each unfilled slot. After every new
            number, a battery of tests are used to make sure the
            number is legal. If it isn't, it backtracks to a previous branch in post order by using recursion. This
            process is repeated
            unti there are no more branches meaning there is no solution, or until the end of the 2D array is reached
            meaning there is a solution.
