        <p>This is a wire routing program that I had programmed in java. The overall concept is that 
            I want to connect a set of points on a board of any size, with a amount of obstacles that the 
            user wants to place. 
            <a href="https://github.com/vivekPatel21/SodukuSolver">here</a> or you can download it yourself <a
                href="images\SodukuSolver-main.zip">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Guide</h2>
        <p>The Program reads through a test file and a certain size. The first two lines are going to set the dimensions of
            the board. Afterwards we come to the obstacles, where the number of obstacles is going to determine the next o lines,
            where o is the number of obstacles. Then for the obstacles, we use the (x,y) coordinate and (x_2,y_2) for the end points
            there to make an obstacle line. The line after that is the amount of wires to connect, and it uses the same logic for the 
            obstacles. For examples I recommend going to the github page and looking at the README.

        <h2>Technical Details</h2>
        <p>The time and space complexity of this program is O(n*m) where n is the dimensions (which could be 3x2) 
            and m is the number of points that need to be connected. Which can sound worrying on the time it takes to solve,
            but by taking advantage of backtracking and recursive techniques, this time is greatly reduced but is not
            reflected in
            big O notation.
            The puzzle is solved by creating a 2D array to store the current working solution the program is developing.
            The program works by going through and trying to connect the points, and if it fails the program reorders
            and attempts again, until it exhausts all options. This greatly reduces time, but it will not be refected 
            in Big-O notation.

        <p>The program goes through the sudoku problem trying a new number in each unfilled slot. After every new
            number, a battery of tests are used to make sure the
            number is legal. If it isn't, it backtracks to a previous branch in post order by using recursion. This
            process is repeated
            unti there are no more branches meaning there is no solution, or until the end of the 2D array is reached
            meaning there is a solution.
